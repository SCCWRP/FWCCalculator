# Flow-Weighting and Event Mean Concentration Calculation

<!-- badges: start -->

The “gold standard” of stormwater control measure (SCM) performance monitoring is to collect and analyze water quality data as flow-weighted event mean concentrations (EMCs). EMCs may be generated by post-storm compositing of discrete samples as an alternative to collecting flow-weighted composite samples using automated equipment with integrated flow meters. Coincidentally, a standard procedure is not documented in industry-relevant literature to perform the requisite post-storm flow-weighting calculations. Lack of a documented procedure may deter data collection for agencies new to monitoring, or for complicated site conditions. It also leads to different approaches to post-storm flow-weighting that may influence resultant EMCs and mass loads.

This web application has been developed to enable consistent, transparent, easily applied calculations for post-storm flow-weighting and compositing and/or to generate an EMC from a pollutograph. The web app provides flow-weighted compositing instructions based on a user-uploaded hydrograph and times of sample collection, or returns an EMC based on a user-uploaded hydrograph and pollutograph. Total hydrograph volume is also returned so that users may determine a mass load from the EMC.

The application is currently hosted at https://sccwrp.shinyapps.io/FWCCalculator/, with code available under an MIT license at https://github.com/SCCWRP/FWCCalculator/. 

The application was subject to a Data Product Quality Assurance review process per SCCWRP policy; documentation of which can be found at https://github.com/SCCWRP/FWCCalculator/QA_Documents/.
